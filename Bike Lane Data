# In this project, I practiced utilizing common table expression to query data from city bike lanes and their ratings.

#1 List all the bike lanes that have an average safety rating of 4.0 or higher
as well as the average safety rating for each of those bike lanes, and a label
that says "Safe Lane".

# WITH safety_average_cte AS (
SELECT street, avg(safetyrating) AS rating
    FROM CityBikeLanes
    GROUP BY street
)

SELECT street, rating, 'Safe Lane' AS label
FROM safety_average_cte
WHERE rating >= 4.0
