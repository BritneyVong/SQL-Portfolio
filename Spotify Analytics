# In this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle and imported into a new table I created. Finally, I used SQL to perform analytics

# To create the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

# Querying the data

# Which artists had songs over 90 popularity and how many?
SELECT artist_name, count(track_name)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING popularity >= 90

#Then I determined who the Top 20 songs by danceability
SELECT track_name, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.SpotifyData
ORDER BY danceability desc
LIMIT 20

#Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table.
Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name,
their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.
